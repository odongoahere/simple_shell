</p>

<p align="center">
This project serves as the realization of a shell, crafted as a pivotal venture within the C programming domain at ALX Africa Software Engineering. </br>
Delving into the shell's intricacies during the initial trimester, it illuminates advanced concepts like processes, system calls, bit manipulation, file management, and error handling. </br>
Aiming to replicate the functionalities of the simple shell (sh), this UNIX command interpreter is meticulously written in the C language.

 ## Description :
This is a coded in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
This originates from work done on [the Thompson Shell](http://www.src.wits.ac.za/groups/psi/linux/rhl-gsg-en-8.0/s1-managing-shells.html).

## Environment :

Our shell was built and tested on a version of Ubuntu.

## Features
*Display a prompt and await user input for command execution, with each command line concluding with a new line.
*In the event of an executable absence, print an error message and prompt the user again.
*Comprehensive error handling.
*Manage the ‚Äúend of file‚Äù condition (Ctrl+D).
*Process command lines with arguments.
*Effectively handle the PATH.
*Implement support for exit features and exit status.
*Prevent the shell from terminating on Ctrl-C.
*Handle command separators ;.
*Manage && and || logical operators.
*Support variable replacements $? and $$.
*Accommodate comments #.
*Incorporate history feature support.
*Enable file input support.

## Builtins
This shell has support for the following built-in commands:
